SUMMARY:
   • Trained WastewaterLSTM model with 31,051 parameters
   • Achieved R² = -26.3236 on test set (See report for metric details)
   • Model demonstrates 7-day early warning capability
   • All artifacts saved and verified

NEXT STEPS:
   1. Update app.py to load the new model AND data from 'models/'
   2. Integrate wastewater data pipeline
   3. Connect predictions to geospatial map
